## Rider Swap: The Secret Weapon for Mixed-Age Families

Traveling with a toddler AND older kids? **Rider Swap** (also called Rider Switch or Child Swap) is your best friend.

### How Rider Swap Works at Disney World

1. Your entire family approaches the cast member at the ride entrance

3. One parent rides with the older kids while the other waits with the toddler
4. After the first group finishes, the waiting parent gets to ride (plus up to 2 guests) through the Lightning Lane

This means older kids can ride twice—once with each parent—while the toddler never has to wait in line bored.

## Tips for Disney World with Toddlers: A Parent's Survival Guide

### Naps Are Non-Negotiable

Toddlers need downtime. Plan for it:
- **Return to your resort** for a pool break and nap (most recommended)
- **Find quiet spots** like the TTA PeopleMover, Hall of Presidents, or Carousel of Progress
- **Use a stroller** for on-the-go napping—bring or rent one with a recline feature

### Snacks, Snacks, Snacks

Hungry toddlers are cranky toddlers. Disney allows outside food, so pack:
- Goldfish, Cheerios, and other familiar favorites
- Pouches and easy-to-eat fruit
- Refillable water bottles (free ice water at any quick-service location)

### Stroller Strategy

- **Bring your own** if flying free with most airlines, or **rent from Disney** or third-party companies
- Mark your stroller with a bright ribbon or tag—thousands look identical
- Know that cast members may move strollers to organize parking areas
- Use the **Baby Care Centers** in each park for quiet feeding, changing, and cooling off

### Timing Is Everything

- **Rope drop** (park opening) is magical with toddlers—shortest waits, coolest temperatures
- **Parade and fireworks times** mean shorter ride lines
- **Don't overplan**—toddler moods change fast, and flexibility prevents meltdowns
